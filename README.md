# Spend Elon Musk Wealth
## Introduction
The rules are simple, you have some billions of dollars and you have to spend them all. There's no time limit (yet) :D.
## Technologies
### React
For the development of this website, I used React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components in response to user actions. This allows for a smooth and responsive user experience. Obviously I also utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the overall design and functionality of the website
### Github Pages
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service (thx github :D) that allows you to host a static website directly from a GitHub repository. It is a quick and easy way to deploy a project and make it available to the public.
